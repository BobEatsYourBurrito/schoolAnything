major force acting on a propeller that tends to pull the blades from the hub : centrifugal
excessive blade tip speed rotating the propeller too fast may result in : poor blade eddif, vibration, fluttering
The prop speed and aircraft speed is limited to : 400 mph
why are turbo prop engine used for higherspeed prop driven aircraft : Effic, shorter take off and landing 
What is the last 6 inches of the blade : tip
what is the flattest portion of the prop blade : face
what part of the prop blade is closest to the hub : root/shank
What is the imaginary line that runs from the leading edge to trailing edge of the blade : chord line
The angle formed beween the chord line and the relative wind : angle of attack (AOA)
The angle formed between the chord line and the propeller plane of rotation : blade angle 
what are the airfoil sections joined side by side to form the blade airfoil : blade Elements
What is an angilar measuremnt and is expressed in degrees that affect the rpm of the engine : blade angle
What is the distance in inches that a propeller section will advance in one revolution : effective pitch
What type of prop uses a flyweight governer that keeps rpm constant : constant speed propeller
What is used in an effort to provide an ideal angle of attack all along the blade : Twist the blade
What two aerodynamic forces are created by the prop : thrust and drag
The purpose of the prop is to convert : rotating energy to linear
the actual horse power an engine produce : brake horse
What is the ratio of theuseful power output to the power input : efficiency
What is the distance a prop should advance in one revolution with no slippage : geometric pitch
What is the distance a prop actually advances in one revolution : effective pitch
What is the difference between the geometric pitch and effective pitch : slippage (slippage is caused by airframe drag)
What are the 3 priciple forces acting on a rotating prop : Tensile(pulling), Tortion, Bending 
What causes tensile stress on the prop : centrifugal
Where is the stress greatest on the prop : Near the Hub / root
What is the result if nicks or scratches remain untreated on the prop blade: Fatique Failure
What mechanism is used to change the blade angle on a controllable pitch prop : Piston in pitch changing mechanism
What is used to regulate the blade angle by controls in the cockpit so that any desired blade angle setting and engine operating speed can be obtained : Prop Governor 
What is a type of vibration in wich the ends of the blade twist back and forth at high frequency around an axis perpendicular to the engine crankshaft : flutter
