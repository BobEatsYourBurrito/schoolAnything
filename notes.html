  <h1>Propellors Highlights Part 1</h1>
  <p class="part1"> 1: There are several forces acting on the prop as it turns; centrifugal fore, bending, and tortion.  <br>
  2: The Major force is centrifugal force. This force at high rpm tends to pull the blades out of the hub. <br>
  3: For higher speed aircraft proppellor-driven arcraft have several advantages such as shorter take off and landing <br>
  4: The Angle of attack (AoA) is the angle formed between the chordline and the relative wind <br>
  5: In an effor to provide an ideal angle of attack along the blade, the blade has a twist which varies the pitch angle of the blade from root to tip <br>
  6: The reason for placing the blade element sections at different angles is because the various sections of the blade travel at different speeds <br>
  7: Pitch is the distance in inches that a propellor section will advance in one revolution <br>
  8: A basic constant speed system consists of a flyweight-equipped governer unit that controls the pitch angle of the blades so that the engine speed remains constant. <br>
  9: The Governer can be regulated by controls in the cockpit so that an desired blade angle setting and engine operating speed can be obtained. <br>
  10: The 2 aerodynamic forces that a propellor create are thrust and drag. <br>
  11: Geometric Pitch is equal to (2 * PI * R * Tangent of blade angle at [R]) where R is 75 % of the blade station. <br>
  12: Blade angle is measured in degrees. <br> 
  13: Centrifugal force is a physical force that tends to throw the rotating propellor blades away from the hub. This is the most dominant force of the propellor. <br> 
  14: A propellor must be capable of withstanding severe stresses which are rgeater near the hub, caused by centrifugal force and thrust. <br>
  15: Aerodynamic twisting force is present on an operating propellor and is caused by the slipstream airflow. <br>
  16: Fixed Pitch and ground-adjustable props are designed for best efficiency at one rotation and forward speed. <br>
  17: A constant speed prop however keeps the blade angle adjusted for maximum efficiency for most conditions encountered in flight. <br>
  18: A constant Speed prop uses a governer to automatically change the propellor pitch in flight. <br>
  19: Fixed Pitch props have no controls and require no adjustment in flight. <br>
  20: The 2 main instruments used with the constant speed propellor are the engine tachometer and the manifold pressure gauge. <br>
  21: Generally, this type of propellor is one peice and is constructed of wood or aluminum alloy. <br>
  22: Fixed Pitch props are designed for best efficiency at one rotational and forward speed. <br>
  23: The fixed Pitch Propeller is used on airplanes of low power, speed, range, or altitude. <br>
  24: The controllable pitch proppeller permits a change of blade pitch or angle while the propellor is rotating. <br>
  25: With the controllable pitch type, the blade angle can be changed in flight but the pilot must change the propellor Directly. The Blade angle will not change again until the pilot changes it. <br>
  26: By Using propeller governors to increase or decrease propellor pitch, the engine soeed is held constant. <br>
  27: Feathering Propellors must be used on multiengine aircraft to reduce propellor drag to a minimum under one or more engine failure conditions. <br>
  28: This aerodynamically brakes the aircraft and reduces the ground roll after landing. Reversing the propellers also reduces aircraft speed quickly on the runway just after touch down and minimizes brake wear. <br>
  29: It consists of a gear pump to increase the pressure of the engine oil. <br>
  30: The tension of the speeder spring sets the maximum rpm of the engine in the governor mode. <br>
  31: The flyweights tilt outward with overspeed and raise the pilot valve to increase blade angle. <br>
  32: When the rpm is below that set by the pilot the flyweights tilt inward and the pilot valve is pushed down. </p>
  <h1>Propellors Highlights Part 2</h1>
  <p class="part2"> 
  1: Fixed-Pitch Propeller restricts its use to small aircraft with low horsepower engines in which maximum engine efficiency during all flight conditions is of lesser importance than in larger aircraft. <br>
  2: Birch is most widely used type of wood for props. <br>
  3: It is secured to the leading edge of the blade by countersunk wood screws and rivets.
  4: to allow this moisture to drain away or be thrown out by centrifugal force. It is important that these drain holes be kept open at all times. <br>
  5: Since wood is subject to swelling, shrinking, and warping because of changes of moisture content, a protective coating is applied to the finished prop to prevent a rapid change of moisture content. <br>
  6: The finish most commonly used is a number of coats of water-repellant, clear vanish. <br>
  7: Propellor shafts - tapered - used on early, low powered engines. <br>
  8: This Splined shaft is identified by SAE number. <br>
  9: Propellor shafts - Flanged - Used on modern opposed engine. <br>
  10: If governer-supplied oil is lost during operation, the propeller increases pitch and feathers. <br>
  11: Isopropyl alcohol is used in some anti-icing systems because of its availability and low cost. <br>
  12: This system is not used on modern aircraft, giving way to the electric deiceing system. <br>
  13: The pilot controls the operation of the deice system by turning on one or more switches. <br>
  14: Deice Timer - the timer or cycling unit determines the sequence of which blades (or portion thereof) are currently being deiced, and for what length of time. <br>
  </p>
  <h1>Props Part 3 </h1>
  <p>1: If a propeller has had a ground strike or sudden stoppage, the recommendations of the engine and propeller need to be adhered to. The Propeller should be disassembled and inspected. <br>
  2: The Inspection of steel blades may be accomplished by either visual, flourecent penetrant, or magnetic particle inspection.<br>
  3: If a propellor vibration is suspected but cannot be positively determined, the ideal troubleshooting method is to temporarily replace the propeller with one known as airworthy and then test fly the aircraft if possible. <br>
  4: If the propeller hub appears to swing in a slight oribit the vibration is usually caused by the propeller. <br>
  5: Blade Shake is not the source of vibration problems <br>
  6: If both propeller tracking and low blade angle setting are correct the propeller is statically or dynamically unbalanced and should be replaced or rebalanced if permitted by the manufactuer. <br>
  7: Blade tracking is the process if determining the position of the tips of the propeller blades relative to each other (blade rotating in the same plane of rotation) <br>
  8: Blade Angle setting and the station at hich the blade angle is checked is found on the applibable manufactuers instructions. <br>
  9: Use a bench-top protractor if the propeller is removed from the aircraft. <br>
 10: The Universal Propeller protrator is specially designed for propellers. <br>
 11: Static unbalance occurs when the center of gravity of the propeller does not coincide with the axis of rotation. <br>
 12: In order to be properly statically balanced the propeller should remain at any position in which it is placed. <br>
 13: We measre velocity using a measurement called IPS or inches per second, this is the most common or universal unit when describing vibration in aviation. <br>
 14: Visually inspect the propeller assy. before dynamic balancing. The first runup of a new or overhaled propeller assy. ma leave a small amount of grease on the blades and inner surface of the spinner dome. <br>
 15: If the engine is removed between overhaul intervals, mounting studs, nuts, and washers may be reused if they are not damaged or corroded. <br>
 16: Prop air domes are charged with air but the preferred charging medium is Nitrogren. <br>
 17: To remove grease or oil from the propeller usrfaces, apply studderd solvent or equivalent to a clean cloth and wipe the parts clean.

<p> 1: The turbo Prop fuel control and the propeller governor are cnonected and operate in coordination with each other. <br>
  2: The beta Range is the range of poer lever positions between flight idle and maximum reverse. <br>
